## Active Work

### ðŸ”§ Bignum Multi-Limb Support (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal**: Fix operators that truncate multi-limb heap integers (values > 2^32)
**Expected Impact**: +100-150 test cases, 25-30% pass rate

#### Completed:
- âœ… **Fixed `<=>` operator** (2025-10-17)
  - File: `lib/core/integer.rb:1682-1714`
  - Changed from `__get_raw` to proper dispatch
  - Verified: Test passes, selftest-c passes

- âœ… **Refactored comparison operators** (2025-10-17)
  - Files: `lib/core/integer.rb:1823-1917` (previously 1825-2016)
  - Replaced `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==` to use `<=>` operator
  - **Code reduction**: ~187 lines â†’ ~94 lines (saved ~93 lines, close to estimated 135)
  - Verified: selftest passes (0 failures), selftest-c passes (0 failures)
  - RubySpec: No change (875 tests, 97 passed, 11% - as expected)
  - Note: `==` kept s-expression dispatch to avoid circular dependency

- âœ… **Improved arithmetic operators** (2025-10-17)
  - **`abs` operator** (lines 1716-1741)
    - Added proper dispatch based on representation (fixnum vs heap)
    - Heap integers now use `__negate` helper via new `__abs_heap` method
    - Structure now correct for multi-limb support
  - **`-@` (unary minus)** (lines 1672-1676)
    - Simplified to directly call `__negate` helper
    - Now properly handles both fixnum and heap integers
    - Removed redundant code
  - **`/` (division)** (lines 1641-1691)
    - Added proper dispatch structure (fixnum/fixnum fast path)
    - Documented that heap cases still use `__get_raw` (truncates multi-limb)
    - FIXME: Need full multi-limb division algorithm
  - **`%` (modulo)** (lines 1459-1511)
    - Added proper dispatch structure with sign handling
    - Documented that heap cases still use `__get_raw` (truncates multi-limb)
    - FIXME: Need full multi-limb division algorithm
  - **Verification**:
    - selftest: PASSED (0 failures)
    - selftest-c: PASSED (0 failures)
    - RubySpec: 97 passed (11%) - no change yet (expected, needs full multi-limb division)

#### Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. **Implement multi-limb division** (6-8h) - **BLOCKING further progress**
   - Currently `/` and `%` truncate multi-limb heap integers
   - Need proper long division algorithm for heap integers
   - Impact: ~30-40 test cases once implemented

2. **Fix bitwise operators** (3-5h)
   - `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`
   - Implement limb-by-limb operations
   - Impact: ~20-30 test cases

**Pattern**: Check representation (fixnum vs heap), dispatch to helpers, handle all combinations

## Priority Queue (Not Started)

### High Priority

#### 1. SEGFAULT Investigation (22 specs, 33%)
**Impact**: Blocks seeing what tests would pass

Top candidates:
- `divmod` - Check if already implemented (integer.rb:2106)
- `times`, `upto`, `downto` - Partially working, investigate Float failures
- Arithmetic operators - May just need type coercion

**Action**: Test each individually to identify real vs imagined problems

#### 2. Type Coercion for Operators
**Impact**: ~30-50 test cases

Many operators already have type checking (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), but some don't:
- `|` and `^` - Need same pattern as `&` (line 1714)
- Check which SEGFAULTs are actually just missing type checks

---

### Medium Priority

#### 3. Test Framework Issues
**Status**: Blocks some tests, not critical

Known issues:
- `eql` function crashes (returns nil)
- String interpolation with nil values crashes
- Mock object issues in some specs

**Impact**: Some specs can't run, but functionality works when tested directly

---

### Lower Priority

#### 4. Float Support
**Impact**: ~40-60 test cases
**Effort**: 10-20 hours (substantial work required)

Many specs fail due to incomplete Float implementation. Better to focus on Integer bugs first.

---

## Recent Findings (2025-10-17)

### âœ… No Parser Regression
Initial concern about lost tests was unfounded:
- Test framework changes (3 specs changed exit codes for skipped tests)
- Metric counting differences
- **Verified**: Parser fixes working correctly, no functionality broken

### âœ… Real Issues Identified
- Bignum operators use `__get_raw` (truncates multi-limb values)
- Test framework has issues (not code bugs)
- Many "SEGFAULTs" may be simple missing methods/type checks
