## Test Adequacy Assessment Complete

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

Key findings:

- **Test script runs cleanly:** 12/12 checks pass, exit code 0
- **All 16 test.md scenarios covered** with automated checks that would correctly fail if the implementation were broken
- **No external dependencies** — all checks use local file operations
- **5 additional spec.md acceptance criteria** lack automated tests but pass manual verification (negative constraints like "file must not reference `bin/improve`"). These are low regression risk for static documentation files and were not required by test.md.
- **Two minor non-blocking issues:** dead `case` block scaffolding and a cosmetic shell error when the guidance file is missing.
