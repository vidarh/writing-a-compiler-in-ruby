## Verification Summary

**All 10 acceptance criteria PASS.**

Here's what I independently verified:

| # | Criterion | Result | Method |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `docs/improvement-planner.md` exists with guidance | PASS | Read file (48 lines), confirmed all required sections present |
| 2 | "Do NOT propose" guidance present | PASS | Lines 38-43 contain four prohibited categories matching requirements |
| 3 | "DO propose" guidance is broad | PASS | Lines 45-48 say "Any improvement" — not over-constrained |
| 4 | No skill references | PASS | grep for all three skill names returned zero matches |
| 5 | No results file references | PASS | grep for `rubyspec_language.txt` etc. returned zero matches |
| 6 | Not limited to subset of specs | PASS | Line 24 explicitly says "Do not limit yourself to any particular subdirectory" |
| 7 | Does not prohibit `.claude` changes | PASS | No mention of `.claude` anywhere in the file |
| 8 | Does not prohibit documentation-only plans | PASS | No mention of "documentation" anywhere in the file |
| 9 | README.md contains `@` reference | PASS | Line 17 contains exactly `@docs/improvement-planner.md` on its own line |
| 10 | No other files modified | PASS | git diff shows only the `@` line added to README.md; improvement-planner.md is the only new file |

**Test suite:** `tools/check_planguide.sh` passes all 12 automated checks. Test adequacy was previously assessed as ADEQUATE.

**No discrepancies** found between automated tests and manual verification. The plan is fully implemented.
