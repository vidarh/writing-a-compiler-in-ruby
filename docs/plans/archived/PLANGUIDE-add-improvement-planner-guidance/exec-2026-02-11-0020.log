All tasks complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

**Files created:**
- **[docs/improvement-planner.md](docs/improvement-planner.md)** — 50-line guidance file with all required sections: test infrastructure overview, investigation workflow, validation requirements, "Do NOT propose" list, and "DO propose" list. Does not reference any untested skills.
- **[tools/check_planguide.sh](tools/check_planguide.sh)** — Verification script checking all acceptance criteria (12 checks, all passing).

**Files modified:**
- **[README.md](README.md)** — Added bare `@docs/improvement-planner.md` reference line between the documentation list and the status section.

**Acceptance criteria status:**
- `docs/improvement-planner.md` exists with guidance for picking, running, and investigating specs
- File includes "Do NOT propose" guidance excluding unvalidated proposals and meta-infrastructure
- File includes "DO propose" guidance favoring compiler/library fixes grounded in live spec output
- File does NOT contain `investigate-spec`, `validate-fix`, or `create-minimal-test`
- README.md contains `@docs/improvement-planner.md` on its own line
- No other project files were modified by this plan
