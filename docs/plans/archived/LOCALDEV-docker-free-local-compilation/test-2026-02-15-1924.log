Assessment complete. Here's the summary:

**Test suite: `bash test/test_localdev.sh`**
- **Result:** 52 passed, 0 failed, 2 skipped
- **Exit code:** 0

**Coverage:** All 18 scenarios from `test.md` have corresponding tests in `test/test_localdev.sh`. The test sections are numbered to match the test.md scenario numbers exactly.

**Skips:** 2 Docker-related tests correctly skipped (Docker not available in this environment, which test.md explicitly allows).

**Minor coverage gaps (none blocking):**
1. `compile`/`compile2` not checked for GCC 8 hardcoding (only setup script checked) — negligible since both use `Dir.glob()`
2. Missing deps simulation not possible in current environment — test.md acknowledges this
3. Incomplete toolchain error path not tested — minor edge case

**VERDICT: ADEQUATE**
