## Assessment Complete

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

The verification script (`verify.sh`) covers all 18 scenarios from the test spec and all tests pass (34/34, exit code 0).

Key findings:
- **All scenarios covered**: File deletions (6), cross-references (2), KNOWN_ISSUES.md checks (3), spec count matching (3), TODO.md checks (2), bignums.md checks (4), preserved files (7)
- **No external dependencies**: Pure POSIX shell, local filesystem only
- **Runtime extraction**: Numbers are pulled from `rubyspec_language.txt` at runtime per the spec's pitfall #6
- **Revert detection**: Tests would fail on most revert scenarios (file deletions, FIXED items, bignums.md size)
- **Minor note**: Some grep patterns (e.g., `Passed.*3`) are slightly permissive and could theoretically match unintended values, but this doesn't affect current correctness
