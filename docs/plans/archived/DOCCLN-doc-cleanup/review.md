- **Key issues**: None - this is a successfully implemented plan
- **Assessment**: This is the only successfully implemented plan in this batch, and it shows why. The plan is comprehensive (228 lines with extensive Implementation Details and Execution Steps sections), surgical in its approach (specific line numbers and edit instructions), and well-scoped (pure housekeeping with zero infrastructure impact). All 6 acceptance criteria were verified. The plan demonstrates the quality bar for successful execution: precise scope, detailed implementation guidance, and verifiable outcomes. No revisions were needed, and verification passed 16 minutes after creation.
