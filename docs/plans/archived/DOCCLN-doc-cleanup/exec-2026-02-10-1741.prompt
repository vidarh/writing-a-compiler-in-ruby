You are implementing an improvement plan. Read the plan spec below and carry out
its Proposed Approach. Work through the Execution Steps checklist if present.
Satisfy all Acceptance Criteria. Work in the directory: /home/vidarh/Desktop/Projects/Compiler

## User direction takes absolute precedence

The plan spec may contain a "User direction" blockquote near the top
(starting with "> **User direction**"). This is the user's most recent
instruction and it is ABSOLUTE LAW. It overrides everything else in
the plan — the scope, the approach, the execution steps, the acceptance
criteria. If anything in the plan contradicts the user direction, the
plan is wrong and the user direction is right. Follow it exactly.
Do not rationalize it away, reinterpret it, or treat it as optional.

## Verify before fixing — do not trust the plan's diagnosis

When the plan or user direction reports a problem ("X is failing",
"Y is broken"), you MUST independently verify it before acting:

1. REPRODUCE the reported problem first. Run the relevant code, read
   the actual error output, check the actual state.
2. DIAGNOSE the cause yourself from the evidence. Do NOT assume the
   plan's explanation of WHY something is failing is correct — the plan
   may contain stale analysis or an agent's guess that was wrong.
3. Only THEN fix the actual cause you found.

The plan may say "X is failing because of Y" — but Y may have been
fixed already and the real cause is Z. If you blindly "fix Y" you will
waste time and may introduce regressions. Always start from the actual
symptoms, not the plan's theory.

# Documentation Cleanup and Archival

[CLEANUP] Remove obsolete docs, archive completed plans, and update stale status data in KNOWN_ISSUES.md and TODO.md.

## Goal Reference

None -- this is standalone housekeeping that benefits all future work.

## Root Cause

Documentation has accumulated organically over months of development sessions.
Each session produced investigation logs, migration plans, and status documents
that were valuable at the time but have since been superseded:

- **Completed plans stay forever**: [KERNEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](docs/KERNEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) and
  [INVESTIGATION_POSTFIX_IF_BUG.md](docs/INVESTIGATION_POSTFIX_IF_BUG.md) document
  work that is done, but remain as if active.
- **Redundant content is never pruned**: [DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md) (18 lines)
  duplicates rules already in CLAUDE.md. [REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md](docs/REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md)
  lessons are captured in [control_flow_as_expressions.md](docs/control_flow_as_expressions.md).
- **Status data rots**: [TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) and [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) say
  "3/78 passing (4%)" but current `rubyspec_language.txt` shows substantially different results.
  [RUBYSPEC_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md](docs/RUBYSPEC_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md) categorizes 50 crashes from 2025-11-26
  that no longer match reality.
- **Session logs masquerade as references**: [bignums.md](docs/bignums.md) is 1679 lines because
  it includes every debugging session, hypothesis, and failed attempt for a feature
  that is now complete across all 9 phases.

The root cause is simply the absence of a periodic cleanup pass. There is no
structural issue preventing cleanup -- all files are committed in git history.

## Infrastructure Cost

Zero. This plan touches only markdown files in docs/. No code changes, no build
system changes, no integration with external tools. The only tool required is
`git rm` and a text editor.

## Scope

**In scope:**

1. `git rm` six obsolete files (all previously committed, retained in history):
   - [DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md) -- entirely redundant with CLAUDE.md
   - [RUBYSPEC_INTEGRATION.md](docs/RUBYSPEC_INTEGRATION.md) -- proposal fully implemented, runner exists
   - [INVESTIGATION_POSTFIX_IF_BUG.md](docs/INVESTIGATION_POSTFIX_IF_BUG.md) -- resolved (commit f00b850), no remaining work
   - [RUBYSPEC_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md](docs/RUBYSPEC_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md) -- data from 2025-11-26, categories no longer match reality
   - [REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md](docs/REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md) -- lessons captured in [control_flow_as_expressions.md](docs/control_flow_as_expressions.md)
   - [KERNEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](docs/KERNEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) -- plan complete (Phases 1-2 done, puts decided, raise migrated); only deferred Enumerable remains (tracked in TODO)

2. Clean [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md):
   - Remove FIXED issues 1 ("super() Uses Wrong Superclass") and 3 ("Classes in Lambdas") from Active Issues section
   - Keep brief mention in "Recent Fixes" section
   - Update spec pass/fail/crash counts from current [rubyspec_language.txt](docs/rubyspec_language.txt)

3. Clean [TODO.md](docs/TODO.md):
   - Remove "1.2 Classes in Lambdas - FIXED" from active items
   - Collapse "1.3 super() - MOSTLY FIXED" to note remaining edge case only
   - Update test status counts from current [rubyspec_language.txt](docs/rubyspec_language.txt)
   - Condense "Recently Completed" / "Previously Completed" to brief one-liners

4. Trim [bignums.md](docs/bignums.md) (~1679 lines) to a concise implementation reference
   (~100-200 lines) by removing session logs, debugging traces, and
   step-by-step investigation narratives for completed phases. Keep:
   - Current status summary (all phases complete)
   - Memory layout and representation design
   - API reference (key methods and their purpose)
   - Known limitations and future work
   - Key design decisions (why Array for limbs, sign handling, bootstrap constraints)

**Out of scope:**
- Rewriting ARCHITECTURE.md or DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md
- Updating rubyspec_language.txt itself (done via `make rubyspec-language`)
- Creating new documentation
- Changing any code

## Expected Payoff

- Six fewer files to scan when orienting in the project
- Status data in TODO.md and KNOWN_ISSUES.md matches reality
- [bignums.md](docs/bignums.md) becomes a usable reference instead of a 1679-line session log
- Reduces confusion for AI agents that read docs/ for context
- Total docs/ file count drops from 18 to 12 (33% reduction)

## Proposed Approach

1. Delete the six obsolete files with `git rm`
2. Edit KNOWN_ISSUES.md: remove FIXED items from Active Issues, update counts
3. Edit TODO.md: remove completed items, update test status
4. Rewrite bignums.md: keep summary, layout, API, decisions; drop session logs
5. Commit all changes in a single commit

## Prior Plans

No prior plans exist in docs/plans/ or docs/plans/archived/.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The six listed files are removed from the working tree (retained in git history)
- [ ] KNOWN_ISSUES.md contains no issues marked FIXED in its Active Issues section
- [ ] KNOWN_ISSUES.md spec counts match the current rubyspec_language.txt summary line
- [ ] TODO.md test status numbers match the current rubyspec_language.txt output
- [ ] TODO.md contains no items marked FIXED as active work items
- [ ] bignums.md is under 250 lines and still documents: current status, all nine phases at summary level, memory layout, key methods, known limitations, and design decisions

## Open Questions

- Should the "Recently Completed" / "Previously Completed" sections in TODO.md be kept at all, or moved to a CHANGELOG? (Propose: keep as a short list, drop detailed descriptions.)

## Implementation Details

### Files to Delete (6 files)

Five of the six files are tracked by git and can be removed with `git rm`:
- [docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md) (18 lines) — `git rm`
- [docs/RUBYSPEC_INTEGRATION.md](docs/RUBYSPEC_INTEGRATION.md) — `git rm`
- [docs/RUBYSPEC_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md](docs/RUBYSPEC_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md) — `git rm`
- [docs/REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md](docs/REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md) — `git rm`
- [docs/KERNEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](docs/KERNEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) — `git rm`

One file is **untracked** (appears in `git status` as `??`):
- [docs/INVESTIGATION_POSTFIX_IF_BUG.md](docs/INVESTIGATION_POSTFIX_IF_BUG.md) — plain `rm`

### Cross-Reference Fixup

[docs/control_flow_as_expressions.md](docs/control_flow_as_expressions.md) references the deleted file `REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md` at two locations:
- Line 147: `See REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md for full analysis.`
- Line 181: `- REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md - Why hack was rejected`

Both lines should be updated to note the file was removed (content preserved in git history). Replace with a note like "(removed — retained in git history)" since the lessons are already captured in the same file's "Attempt 3" section.

[docs/bignums.md](docs/bignums.md) references two deleted investigation files at line 506-507:
- `docs/FIXNUM_CLASS_METHOD_INVESTIGATION.md`
- `docs/FIXNUM_TO_INTEGER_MIGRATION.md`

However, these files are NOT in the deletion list and do NOT exist on disk — they are stale references that should simply be removed during the bignums.md rewrite.

### KNOWN_ISSUES.md Edits ([docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md))

**Current state**: 184 lines, last updated 2025-12-01.

**Stale counts at lines 10-13** — replace with current values from [docs/rubyspec_language.txt](docs/rubyspec_language.txt):
- PASSED: 3 → **4** (and_spec, not_spec, unless_spec, *plus one more* — verify from rubyspec_language.txt line 78-80, unless_spec appears twice due to output glitch but the summary says 3; keep as 3 if summary is authoritative)
- FAILED: ~23 → **28**
- CRASHED: ~52 → **47**
- Individual test counts: update to P:272 F:705 S:17 T:994, pass rate 27%

**Active Issues section (lines 42-132)** — remove two FIXED issues:
- **Issue 1** (lines 44-55): "super() Uses Wrong Superclass - FIXED" — delete entire subsection. The remaining edge case (`define_method(:name) { super() }`) should be noted in Issue 2-level detail or kept as a one-liner under "Recent Fixes".
- **Issue 3** (lines 119-131): "Classes in Lambdas - FIXED" — delete entire subsection.

After deletion, renumber remaining active issues:
- Current Issue 2 ("Break from Blocks") → becomes Issue 1
- Current Issue 4 ("Keyword Arguments") → becomes Issue 2
- Current Issue 5 ("Compound Expression After If/Else") → becomes Issue 3

Add one-liner for super() remaining edge case to "Recent Fixes" section or keep as brief note:
- `super()` in `define_method` blocks still unsupported (needs method name from define_method arg).

### TODO.md Edits ([docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md))

**Current state**: 117 lines, last updated 2025-12-01.

**Stale counts at lines 9-13** — replace with current values from [docs/rubyspec_language.txt](docs/rubyspec_language.txt):
- PASSED: 3 (4%) → **3 (4%)** (summary line says 3, but individual pass rate is 27% for test cases)
- FAILED: ~23 (29%) → **28 (36%)**
- CRASHED: ~52 (67%) → **47 (60%)**
- Add individual test case stats: 994 total, 272 passed, 705 failed, 17 skipped, 27% pass rate

**Remove section 1.2** (lines 42-44): "Classes in Lambdas - FIXED" — entirely.

**Collapse section 1.3** (lines 48-58): "super() Implementation - MOSTLY FIXED" — reduce to a single bullet noting the remaining `define_method` edge case. Since the main fix is done, this can move to a brief note under the break-from-blocks section or be left as a minimal item.

**Condense "Recently Completed" section** (lines 87-91): Remove detail, keep as brief one-liners.

**Condense "Previously Completed" section** (lines 93-101): Remove detail, keep as brief one-liners.

### bignums.md Rewrite ([docs/bignums.md](docs/bignums.md))

**Current state**: 1678 lines.

**Target**: Under 250 lines. Write a new file preserving these sections from the original:

1. **Status Summary** (~10 lines) — from lines 1-16. All 9 phases complete, selftest-c passes, Fixnum minimized to 10 methods.

2. **Architecture / Design Decisions** (~30 lines) — distilled from:
   - Lines 122-134: "Implementation Approach" (no separate Bignum class, unified Integer)
   - Lines 477-499: "Why Array for Limbs?", "Sign Handling", "Unified Integer Class"
   - Lines 354-382: "No Large Literals During Compilation" constraint (still relevant for bootstrap)

3. **Memory Layout** (~25 lines) — from lines 446-474: Tagged fixnum format, heap-allocated Integer format, detection method, limb representation.

4. **Phase Summary** (~40 lines) — one paragraph per phase distilled from the per-phase sections (lines 135-353, 509-606, 607-1125, 1127-1383, 1384-1467). Keep only: what was implemented, key files, any remaining limitations. No commit hashes, no debugging narratives, no test output.

5. **Key Methods Reference** (~30 lines) — extract from lines 43-77 ("What Works") and the Phase 7 summary (lines 1131-1172). List the important public and internal methods with one-line descriptions.

6. **Known Limitations and Future Work** (~30 lines) — from lines 1625-1678. Keep: compiler-level limitations, arithmetic limitations (broken operators list), future enhancements.

7. **References** (~5 lines) — from lines 501-507, but remove stale file references (FIXNUM_CLASS_METHOD_INVESTIGATION.md, FIXNUM_TO_INTEGER_MIGRATION.md don't exist).

**Content to remove entirely** (the bulk):
- Per-phase "Commits:" lists (dozens of commit hashes)
- "Investigation Notes" and "Bugs Fixed" sub-sections within phases
- "Blocker" narratives in Phase 6 steps (lines 311-329)
- Comprehensive Solution Plan for Phase 7 (lines 626-948) — code examples, Option A/B analysis
- Implementation Roadmap and Progress (lines 948-1125) — session-level detail
- Phase 6 Step 5 detailed implementation (lines 1384-1467)
- Testing Approach section (lines 1468-1534)
- Bignum Comparison Investigation session log (lines 1536-1623)
- All inline test result listings (e.g., lines 91-96, 101-103, 543-551, 599-603, 1176-1183)

## Execution Steps

1. [ ] Delete the five git-tracked obsolete files — run `git rm docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md docs/RUBYSPEC_INTEGRATION.md docs/RUBYSPEC_CRASH_ANALYSIS.md docs/REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md docs/KERNEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
2. [ ] Delete the untracked file — run `rm docs/INVESTIGATION_POSTFIX_IF_BUG.md`
3. [ ] Fix cross-references in [docs/control_flow_as_expressions.md](docs/control_flow_as_expressions.md) — update lines 147 and 181 to replace references to `REJECTED_APPROACH_METHOD_CHAINING.md` with a note that the file was removed (content preserved in git history, lessons already captured in Attempt 3 section above)
4. [ ] Edit [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) — update the "Current State Summary" counts (lines 10-13) to match [docs/rubyspec_language.txt](docs/rubyspec_language.txt): Passed 3, Failed 28, Crashed 47; individual tests: 994 total, 272 passed, 705 failed, 17 skipped, 27% pass rate
5. [ ] Edit [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) — remove FIXED Issue 1 (lines 44-55, "super() Uses Wrong Superclass") and FIXED Issue 3 (lines 119-131, "Classes in Lambdas") from Active Issues; renumber remaining issues; add super() remaining edge case (`define_method` blocks) as a brief note under Recent Fixes
6. [ ] Edit [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) — update the "Test Status" counts (lines 9-13) to match [docs/rubyspec_language.txt](docs/rubyspec_language.txt): Passed 3 (4%), Failed 28 (36%), Crashed 47 (60%); add individual test case stats (994 total, 272 passed, 27% pass rate)
7. [ ] Edit [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) — remove section 1.2 "Classes in Lambdas - FIXED" (lines 42-44); collapse section 1.3 "super() Implementation" (lines 48-58) to a single bullet for the remaining `define_method` edge case
8. [ ] Edit [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) — condense "Recently Completed" (lines 87-91) and "Previously Completed" (lines 93-101) sections to brief one-liner lists without detailed descriptions
9. [ ] Rewrite [docs/bignums.md](docs/bignums.md) — replace the 1678-line file with a concise implementation reference under 250 lines, preserving: status summary, architecture/design decisions, memory layout, one-paragraph-per-phase summary, key methods reference, known limitations, and references. Remove all commit hashes, debugging session logs, investigation narratives, blocker analyses, and inline test output
10. [ ] Verify acceptance criteria — confirm: six files removed, no FIXED items in KNOWN_ISSUES.md Active Issues, spec counts match rubyspec_language.txt in both KNOWN_ISSUES.md and TODO.md, bignums.md is under 250 lines with all required content sections present

---
*Status: APPROVED (implicit via --exec)*
---END PLAN SPEC---

A test specification exists at /home/vidarh/Desktop/Projects/Compiler/docs/plans/DOCCLN-doc-cleanup/test.md. Read it — it defines
the automated test suite you MUST write as part of this implementation.

Implement the plan. Do not ask questions — make reasonable choices.

If the plan has an "## Execution Steps" section with a checklist, work through
the steps in order. Check off each step as you complete it.

IMPORTANT: If the plan contains unchecked acceptance criteria with FAIL notes,
a prior execution attempt failed verification. Focus on fixing the FAILed
criteria. Do not redo work that already passed unless it is broken.

Do NOT write to /home/vidarh/Desktop/Projects/Compiler/docs/plans/DOCCLN-doc-cleanup/log.md or to the spec file at /home/vidarh/Desktop/Projects/Compiler/docs/plans/DOCCLN-doc-cleanup/spec.md.
The log and spec are managed by the orchestrator, not by you.
Focus exclusively on implementing the plan in the target project.

IMPORTANT: .cache/ is for regenerable cache data ONLY. NEVER write scripts,
non-deterministic research results, or any content that cannot be wiped and
recreated to .cache/. Scripts go in bin/. Persistent data goes in docs/ or
the target project directory.

## File placement rules — NEVER litter the project root

Do NOT create loose files or directories in the root of /home/vidarh/Desktop/Projects/Compiler.
This is a coordination project, not a dumping ground. All files MUST go
in the appropriate subdirectory:
- Scripts → bin/
- Documentation, guides, setup notes → docs/
- Plan artifacts → the plan's own directory under docs/plans/
- Data files for other projects → that project's own directory

If the plan targets a different project (e.g., ACT, compiler, Novelator),
implementation files belong in THAT project's directory, not here.
Desktop/ may only contain links, dashboard fragments, or references.

NEVER create top-level .md files, data files, setup guides, or quickstart
documents in the project root. If you find yourself writing to a path like
`/home/vidarh/Desktop/Projects/Compiler/SOMETHING.md` (not inside a subdirectory), STOP — that file
belongs in docs/ or in the target project.

## Overcorrection guard

When implementing changes based on constraints or feedback:
- Change ONLY what is specifically described as wrong. Do not remove working
  functionality that is not mentioned in the feedback.
- Do NOT invent broader constraints than what was stated. "Don't write to X"
  means exactly that — not "don't write anywhere" or "don't create files."
- If a constraint is ambiguous, interpret it NARROWLY (the specific thing
  mentioned), not broadly (everything remotely related).
- Before removing any existing code or functionality, ask: "Was this
  specifically identified as a problem?" If not, leave it alone.

## Automated test suite is a mandatory deliverable

If test.md exists in the plan directory, read it for the test specification.
Your implementation is NOT complete until:

1. You have written the automated test suite (per test.md or covering your changes)
2. The test suite runs and passes WITHOUT network access or live services
3. External dependencies (APIs, databases, services) are mocked/stubbed
4. The test suite covers the SPECIFIC changes you made — not just the happy path
5. Error paths are tested (connection failures, malformed data, missing resources)

If the code is too tightly coupled to external services to mock, you MUST
refactor it first to support dependency injection or a swappable backend.
Needing real data or live services to run tests is a design bug — fix the design.

"Tests pass" is insufficient — the tests must actually exercise your code paths.
If you modified a method, there must be tests for that method's OTHER behaviors
too, not just the new behavior.

## Follow instructions exactly

When the plan or test.md specifies how to invoke a deliverable, use that
EXACT command. Do NOT substitute `ruby bin/X` for `bin/X`. Do NOT invent
alternative invocations.

If you get errors (500s, crashes, unexpected output), they are REAL errors.
Do NOT dismiss them as "expected." Investigate them. If your experience
differs from what the user reported, assume YOUR testing method is wrong —
not the user. Check: did you use the exact command? The exact arguments?

## Dangerous execution: system-level code

If the plan modifies code that interfaces with system-level resources (terminals,
signals, process groups, file descriptors, network sockets, servers), you MUST:
1. Run the full test suite BEFORE making any changes to establish a baseline
2. Run the full test suite AFTER each individual change
3. If tests fail after a change, revert immediately — do NOT layer more changes
   on top of a broken state
4. NEVER launch the modified program directly (e.g. `ruby rsh.rb`, `./server`)
   — only run the test suite. Broken system-level code can crash the user's machine.
5. If the test suite itself interacts with terminal/process control, run it with
   output capture and timeouts to prevent runaway processes.

## Non-interactive execution

You are running NON-INTERACTIVELY. You cannot pause for user confirmation.
If the plan contains instructions like "STOP AFTER THIS", "wait for user
confirmation", or "do not proceed to Phase N without approval", you MUST
still complete your execution — but limit your scope to the FIRST phase only.
Do NOT attempt subsequent phases that require user confirmation gates.
If the plan is structured as Phase 1 → STOP → Phase 2, execute Phase 1 ONLY.

IMPORTANT: Use markdown link format for all file, plan, goal, and project references.
