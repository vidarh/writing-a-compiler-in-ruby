## Assessment Complete

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

All 8 test scenarios from `test.md` have corresponding checks in `verify.sh`, and all pass (8/8, exit code 0):

1. Slow-targets section exists in `improvement-planner.md` — PASS
2. Targets described as slow with re-run-only-for-validation guidance — PASS
3. Read-the-file guidance references results files — PASS
4. Auto-write/tee guidance present — PASS
5. Slow-target note in CLAUDE.md Testing subsection — PASS
6. Auto-write/results-file note in CLAUDE.md — PASS
7. No reference to `rubyspec_language_new.txt` (edge case) — PASS
8. `make spec` not listed as slow (edge case) — PASS

No coverage gaps identified. The tests are appropriately scoped for a documentation-only change — they use flexible regex matching (not hard-coded prose), check section boundaries (not line numbers), include negative/edge-case checks, and would fail if the implementation were reverted.
