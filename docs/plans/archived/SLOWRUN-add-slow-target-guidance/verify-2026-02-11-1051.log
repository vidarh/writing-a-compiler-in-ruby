## Verification Summary

**All 4 acceptance criteria PASS.**

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | improvement-planner.md: targets slow / re-run only for validation | **PASS** | Lines 22-24 say "slow", lines 42-44 say "Only re-run...to validate actual code changes" |
| 2 | improvement-planner.md: read results files for current state | **PASS** | Lines 39-41: "Read the results files...to understand current spec status. Do NOT re-run..." |
| 3 | improvement-planner.md: auto-write via tee / no manual piping | **PASS** | Lines 33-35: "automatically writes...via `tee`"; lines 45-48: "Never manually pipe" |
| 4 | CLAUDE.md: slow-target note near rubyspec targets | **PASS** | Line 178: "Slow targets:" paragraph placed directly after rubyspec bullet points, mentions slow runtime, auto-write via tee, and read-files-not-rerun guidance |

**Additional edge case checks:**
- `rubyspec_language_new.txt` is NOT referenced in improvement-planner.md — correct
- `make spec` is explicitly called "fast" and excluded from slow-targets guidance — correct
- Verification script (`verify.sh`) passes 8/8

**Verdict: PLAN COMPLETE — all acceptance criteria independently verified.**
