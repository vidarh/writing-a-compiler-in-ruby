## Verification Report: GITCLEAN Plan

**Result: 7 of 8 criteria PASS, 1 FAILS**

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Rubyspec submodule clean | **PASS** | `git diff rubyspec` = no output; `git -C rubyspec status --porcelain` = no output |
| 2 | Submodule pointer at 6267cc7 | **PASS** | `git ls-tree HEAD rubyspec` = `6267cc755b6519f500539bd502e0b86a35581333` |
| 3 | Clean working tree | **FAIL** | 7 dirty items: 2 modified goals files + 5 untracked GITCLEAN plan artifacts |
| 4 | Multiple thematic commits | **PASS** | 10 commits in last 10, covering 5+ work streams with clear thematic separation |
| 5 | make selftest passes | **PASS** | Both `make selftest` and `make selftest-c` pass with 0 failures |
| 6 | CLAUDE.md Rubyspec Submodule section | **PASS** | All 4 sub-requirements verified: forbids changes, states aspiration, identifies runner as temporary, requires workarounds outside submodule |
| 7 | CLAUDE.md Git Workflow section | **PASS** | Requires feature branches for non-trivial changes, requires committing before new tasks |
| 8 | Clean working tree policy | **PASS** | Line 193: "the working tree should be clean before starting new work" |

**Failing criterion details:**

The working tree is not clean. `git status` shows:
- `M docs/goals/PARSARCH-parser-architecture.md` — added notes by post-execution agents
- `M docs/goals/SELFHOST-clean-bootstrap.md` — added notes by post-execution agents
- 5 untracked files in `docs/plans/GITCLEAN-*/` — execution logs, test logs, and adequacy review generated by the plan framework after execution completed

These are all post-execution artifacts created by the plan infrastructure *after* the plan finished. The plan's own verify.sh confirms it passed all 37 checks at execution time (0 failures). However, the acceptance criterion says "git status shows a clean working tree" and right now it does not, so this criterion cannot pass strict adversarial verification.

**verify.sh test suite results:** 33 passed, 2 failed (the same working-tree cleanliness checks), 2 skipped (selftest — verified separately by running them directly).
