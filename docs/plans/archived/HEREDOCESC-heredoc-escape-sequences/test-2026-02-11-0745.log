## Test Adequacy Review Complete

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

All 14 testable scenarios from `test.md` have corresponding passing tests in `spec/heredoc_escape_spec.rb`:

- **13/13 custom tests pass** (exit 0) — covering `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\e`, `\r`, line continuation, `\#` preventing interpolation, escapes + interpolation coexistence, single-quoted heredocs, squiggly heredocs, `\\` before newline, unknown escapes, and multiple consecutive escapes
- **14/16 rubyspec heredoc tests pass** (as expected — 2 failures are eval/NameError, explicitly out of scope)
- **`make selftest`** — 0 failures
- **`make selftest-c`** — 0 failures

No coverage gaps, no external dependencies, no mocking needed. Tests would fail if the implementation were reverted. Report written to `docs/plans/HEREDOCESC-heredoc-escape-sequences/test-adequacy.md`.
