Assessment complete. Here's the summary:

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

All 14 testable scenarios from test.md are covered by tests in `spec/heredoc_escape_spec.rb`:
- **5 basic escape sequences** (`\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\e`, `\r`) - all pass
- **Line continuation** (`\<newline>`) - passes
- **Interpolation interaction** (`\#` prevention, mixed escapes+interpolation) - both pass
- **Single-quoted heredoc** (backslashes preserved literally) - passes
- **Squiggly heredoc** (`<<~` with `\n`) - passes
- **4 edge cases** (double-backslash before newline, unknown escapes, consecutive escapes, implicit EOF) - all pass

**Test suite results:**
- `./run_rubyspec spec/heredoc_escape_spec.rb` — **13 passed, 0 failed**
- `./run_rubyspec rubyspec/language/heredoc_spec.rb` — **14 passed, 2 failed** (2 failures are expected eval/NameError-dependent, out of scope)
- `make selftest` — **Fails: 0**
- `make selftest-c` — **Fails: 0**

No coverage gaps, no external dependencies, no mocking concerns. Tests would fail if the implementation were reverted.
