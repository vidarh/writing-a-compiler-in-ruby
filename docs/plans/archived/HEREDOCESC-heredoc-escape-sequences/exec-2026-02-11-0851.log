All tasks are complete. Here's the summary:

## Implementation Complete

**Bug fixed**: BufferedScanner's `peek`/`get` were falling through to the real scanner when the buffer was empty. This caused the tokenizer's multi-character operator lookahead (reading 2-3 chars in `get_raw`) to accidentally read from the real scanner, then `unget` those characters back into the BufferedScanner's buffer — creating duplicate characters.

**Fix**: Changed `peek` and `get` to return `nil` when the buffer is empty instead of delegating to the real scanner. The `term` callback (`buf_empty?`) stops the `Quoted.escaped` loop before exhaustion, so this is safe.

### Test Results

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| `make selftest` | 0 failures |
| `make selftest-c` | 0 failures |
| `spec/heredoc_escape_spec.rb` | **13/13 pass** |
| `rubyspec/language/heredoc_spec.rb` | **14/16 pass** (2 remaining failures: eval/NameError, out of scope) |
| `make rubyspec-language` | 269 passes (no regression from our changes; heredoc improved 13→14) |

### Files Modified

- **`scanner.rb`** — Added `BufferedScanner` class; `peek`/`get` return nil when buffer empty
- **`quoted.rb`** — Handle nil `q` parameter for heredoc term-based termination
- **`tokens.rb`** — Heredoc body processing uses `BufferedScanner` + `Quoted.expect_dquoted` instead of duplicated loop
- **`parserbase.rb`** — Added `scanner=` setter for BufferedScanner swapping
- **`docs/rubyspec_language.txt`** — Updated via `make rubyspec-language`

### Acceptance Criteria

- No `unget` of modified/constructed buffers
- Heredoc bodies flow through `Quoted.expect_dquoted` (no separate handling)
- Dedent happens before escape processing
- All selftests pass
