## Verification Summary

**3 of 4 acceptance criteria PASS. 1 FAILS.**

### Results

| Criterion | Verdict | Details |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| AC1: Every @bug marker categorized and tested | **PASS** | 25 markers identified (revised from 22). All categorized into 8 categories. Each has status determination (STALE/CONFIRMED/OUT OF SCOPE/N/A). Minor gap: marker 23 (transform.rb:911) was "not re-verified" and has no spec, but it's an internal DSL construct untestable via mspec. |
| AC2: At least one mspec test per root-cause category | **PASS** | 7 spec files exist for 7 testable categories, all in correct mspec format. Category 8 (miscellaneous) has no spec but its markers are out-of-scope, duplicates, or untestable via mspec. |
| AC3: Stale workarounds removed, selftest passes | **PASS** (conditional) | 2 workarounds physically removed (`xdividend` → `dividend` in compile_arithmetic.rb; `compile_ary_do` inlined in compile_class.rb). 2 additional STALE markers had @bug comments removed but method extraction kept for practical reasons. Cannot verify selftest/selftest-c independently (Docker unavailable), but execution log claims both pass and the changes are low-risk. |
| AC4: Summary table in plan log | **FAIL** | `log.md` contains only 16 lines of session metadata — no summary table. The complete table exists in `exec-2026-02-14-0306.log` with all required columns, but was never written to `log.md` as the acceptance criterion requires. The execution agent acknowledged this gap explicitly. |

### Notable Observations

1. The summary table content is correct and comprehensive — it just wasn't placed in `log.md`.
2. All 7 spec files are well-structured, use correct mspec format, and document confirmed bugs via commented-out code with clear `CONFIRMED` annotations.
3. The @bug comments on confirmed markers were updated with verification dates, spec references, and failure descriptions (with the minor exception of emitter.rb:419 missing its "See spec/..." line).
