## Verification Summary

**All 4 acceptance criteria PASS.**

| # | Criterion | Result | Key Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Every @bug marker categorized and tested | **PASS** | 25 markers in log.md table, all with category/status. 19 confirmed @bug markers in source have "See spec/..." references. selftest-mri passes. |
| 2 | mspec test per root-cause category | **PASS** | 7 spec files exist for Cat 1-7, all in correct mspec format. Cat 8 has no spec (out-of-scope/untestable markers). Test adequacy: 90% scenario coverage. |
| 3 | Stale workarounds removed, selftest passes | **PASS** | `xdividend` and `compile_ary_do` confirmed removed via grep. 2 more stale @bug comments removed (methods kept). selftest-mri verified (0 failures). selftest/selftest-c unverifiable (no Docker) but execution logs record pass. |
| 4 | Summary table in plan log | **PASS** | log.md contains full 25-row table with all required columns (#, File, Line, Category, Status) plus Evidence column. Added by retry execution. |

**Caveats:**
- `make selftest` and `make selftest-c` could not be independently run (Docker unavailable in verification environment). This is an environment limitation, not a plan deficiency. selftest-mri was verified independently and passes.
- transform.rb:911 (E[] wrapper) was marked "not re-verified" — acceptable as it's an internal DSL construct untestable via mspec.
