Assessment written to `/tmp/improve-wrapper/Compiler/docs/plans/BUGAUDIT-validate-bug-workarounds/test-adequacy.md`.

## Summary

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

Key findings:

- **7/7 spec files** exist, all in correct mspec format, covering all 7 bug categories
- **36/40 required scenarios** (90%) are present as either runnable tests or documented commented-out confirmed bugs
- **4 missing scenarios**: `range` argument collision (Cat 2), deep nesting collision (Cat 2), no-block variant of block_given? (Cat 4, untestable), and `break value` form (Cat 7)
- **2 workaround removals** (`xdividend`, `compile_ary_do`) are covered by the relevant specs and validated by selftest + selftest-c
- **Test suite could not run** in the current environment (Docker socket unavailable in sandbox). The execution agent's recorded results from the Docker-enabled session are the authoritative source. `make selftest-mri` passes confirming the compiler frontend works.

The missing scenarios are minor — none undermine the plan's acceptance criterion of "at least one mspec test per distinct root-cause category." The two most notable gaps (`range` argument test, `break value` form) would be good additions but are not blockers.
