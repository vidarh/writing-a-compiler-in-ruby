Assessment written to `docs/plans/BUGAUDIT-validate-bug-workarounds/test-adequacy.md`.

**Overall verdict: ADEQUATE**

Key findings:

- **All 7 required spec files exist** covering all 7 bug categories
- **29 of 33 required scenarios** are present (88%)
- **Test suite could not run** in this environment (Docker unavailable for x86-32 assembly/linking), but execution log confirms all specs were compiled and run successfully during the execution session
- **4 minor gaps** identified:
  1. Missing `range` argument collision test (Cat 2) — confirmed bug, would be documentation only
  2. Missing deep nesting collision edge case (Cat 2) — low priority extension
  3. Missing no-block variant of nested `block_given?` (Cat 4) — untestable since the method itself segfaults
  4. Missing `break value` form test (Cat 7) — most notable gap, distinct language feature

The gaps are not blockers because the plan's acceptance criteria require "at least one mspec test per distinct root-cause category," and all 7 categories have tests. The execution agent also correctly validated workaround removals with `make selftest && make selftest-c`.
