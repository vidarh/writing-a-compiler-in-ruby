## Assessment Complete

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

The test suite at `test/test_localdev.sh` covers all 18 scenarios specified in `test.md`:

- **55 passed, 0 failed, 3 skipped** (skips are justified: Docker unavailable, git worktree limitation)
- All file existence, permission, and deletion checks pass
- `.gitignore` exception verified with ordering
- Makefile targets exist and are syntactically valid
- Toolchain setup works and is idempotent
- GCC version is dynamically detected (no hardcoded GCC 8)
- `COMPILE_MODE=local`, `COMPILE_MODE=docker`, and auto-detect all tested
- Error path tested (forced local mode without toolchain → non-zero exit)
- tgc.o caching verified via mtime comparison
- `make selftest` and `make selftest-c` both pass end-to-end
- `run_rubyspec` works transparently
- Docker volume mount differences preserved between `compile` and `compile2`
- No compiler source code was modified
