## Verification Summary

**Result: 3 of 8 criteria PASS, 5 criteria FAIL (2 definitively, 3 due to inability to verify)**

### Criteria that PASS (3/8):

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `comparable.rb` implements all 6 methods | **PASS** | File read: all 6 methods present with correct logic |
| 2 | `include Comparable` added to String | **PASS** | Via class reopening in `comparable.rb:40-42` (spec's own Implementation Details endorses this approach) |
| 3 | `include Comparable` added to Symbol | **PASS** | Via class reopening in `comparable.rb:44-46` |

### Criteria that FAIL (5/8):

| # | Criterion | Status | Reason |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| 4 | `make selftest` passes | **UNVERIFIED** | Docker unavailable. `make selftest-mri` passes. Exec log claims pass but cannot independently confirm. |
| 5 | `make selftest-c` passes | **UNVERIFIED** | Docker unavailable. Exec log claims pass with 2 known failures (unchanged). Cannot independently confirm. |
| 6 | `between_spec.rb` passes 2/2 | **FAIL** | Exec log explicitly reports FAILURE due to pre-existing compiler limitation (inherited `initialize`). |
| 7 | `lt_spec.rb` runs without crash | **FAIL** | Exec log explicitly reports FAILURE to compile — `:<=>` symbol literal not parseable. |
| 8 | String `"a" < "b"` works compiled | **UNVERIFIED** | Docker unavailable. Exec log claims custom specs pass 17/17. Cannot independently compile and run. |

### Key observations:

- **The core implementation is correct.** The Comparable module code is well-written and logically sound (verified under MRI).
- **Custom specs (57/57) reportedly pass**, but this cannot be independently verified without Docker.
- **Criteria 6 and 7 definitively fail** per the execution agent's own log. The upstream rubyspec comparable tests fail due to pre-existing compiler limitations (`:symbol` literal parsing, inherited `initialize`), not due to Comparable implementation bugs.
- **Criteria 4, 5, and 8 are unverifiable** in this environment. The exec log and commit message claim they pass, but adversarial verification requires independent confirmation.
