Assessment written to `docs/plans/COMPARABLE-implement-comparable-module/test-adequacy.md`.

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

Summary of findings:

- **3 test files** created matching the test specification exactly: `comparable_operators_spec.rb` (30 tests), `comparable_string_spec.rb` (17 tests), `comparable_symbol_spec.rb` (10 tests)
- **57/57 custom spec assertions pass** per the execution log
- **All 66 scenarios** from test.md are accounted for — 57 directly tested, upstream rubyspec runs attempted (fail due to pre-existing compiler limitations), bootstrap validation passes
- **Error paths covered**: nil `<=>` return, cross-type comparisons, boundary values, negative numbers, empty strings
- **1 minor adaptation**: Scenario 13 (`Comparable#==` on distinct equal-valued objects) cannot work on `ComparableTest` due to vtable slot semantics, but the code path IS exercised through Symbol where Comparable's `==` is the active implementation
- **No external dependencies**, no mocking needed, no network access required
- **MRI validation** (53/53) independently confirms test logic is correct
- **Tests would fail** if the implementation were reverted (String/Symbol would lose all comparison operators)
