Here's a summary of the verification results for all acceptance criteria:

**Acceptance Criteria Status:**

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `make selftest` — 0 failures | **PASS** — 0 failures |
| 2 | `make selftest-c` — no new failures | **PASS** — 0 failures (improved from 2 pre-existing failures, now 0) |
| 3 | `"a" < "b"` returns `true` when compiled | **PASS** — verified with compiled binary |
| 4 | Custom specs (57 tests) pass | **PASS** — 30 + 17 + 10 = 57 tests, 0 failures |
| 5 | `between_spec.rb` — 1/1 test passes | **PASS** — 1 passed, 0 failed |
| 6 | `lt_spec.rb` — runs without crash | **PASS** — compiles and runs, no segfault |
| 7 | `lt_spec.rb` — first `it` block passes | **CANNOT PASS** — uses `should_receive` mocking on real objects, which requires runtime method replacement (incompatible with AOT compilation) |
| 8 | `Integer </>` not regressed | **PASS** — verified via selftest and custom specs |

**Fixes committed:**

1. **`e58bd3f`** — Fix module-nested class inheritance and `:<=>` symbol parsing
   - `transform.rb`: Scope-aware superclass lookup for module-nested classes
   - `compile_class.rb`: Same fix in two compilation paths + inline `compile_ary_do`
   - `sym.rb`: Parse `:<=>` correctly (was stopping at `:<=`)

**Bonus improvement:** The module-nested inheritance fix also resolved 2 pre-existing `selftest-c` failures, bringing the count from 2 to 0.
