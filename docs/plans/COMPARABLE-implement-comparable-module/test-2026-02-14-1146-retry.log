Assessment written to `docs/plans/COMPARABLE-implement-comparable-module/test-adequacy.md`.

**Verdict: ADEQUATE**

Key findings:

- **3 test files** exist matching the test specification exactly: `comparable_operators_spec.rb` (30 tests), `comparable_string_spec.rb` (17 tests), `comparable_symbol_spec.rb` (10 tests)
- **57/57 custom spec assertions pass** per execution logs
- **All 66 scenarios** from test.md are accounted for — every scenario has a corresponding test or documented adaptation
- **Error paths covered**: nil `<=>` return, cross-type comparisons (string vs int, symbol vs string), boundary values, negative numbers, empty strings
- **1 adaptation**: Scenario 13 (`Comparable#==` on distinct equal-valued objects) cannot work on `ComparableTest` due to vtable slot semantics, but the same code path IS exercised through Symbol tests where `Comparable#==` is the active implementation
- **No external dependencies** — pure computation, no mocking needed
- **MRI validation**: 52/52 non-nil-path assertions independently confirmed correct
- **Syntax check**: All 3 spec files + implementation pass `ruby -c`
- **Docker unavailable** for independent compilation-based verification, but execution logs report all tests passing
