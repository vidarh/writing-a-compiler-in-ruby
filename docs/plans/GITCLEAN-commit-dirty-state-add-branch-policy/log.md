User feedback: The rubyspec submodule should not be allowed to have achanges. Changes to the rubyspec submodule should be weeded out, and the documentation should call it out as not allowed - we aspire to passing the *unmodified* rubyspec; for now we're using a custom running, but even that needs to change - as the custom runner approaches 'real mspec' we need to eventually consider a migration to the actual mspec.
