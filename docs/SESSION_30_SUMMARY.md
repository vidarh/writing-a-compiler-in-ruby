# Session 30 Summary - Partial Exception Handling Fix

## Goal
Fix rescue-in-block problem to enable exception handling across all contexts.

## What Was Accomplished ‚úÖ

### Fixed: Methods and Top-Level Rescue
- **Top-level rescue blocks** now work correctly  
- **Rescue in methods** now works correctly
- Exception propagation and stack unwinding works properly

### Root Cause Identified
Changed from **class variables** (@@exc_stack) to **instance variables on singleton** ($__exception_runtime).
This fixed methods and top-level contexts.

## What Still Doesn't Work ‚ùå

### Rescue Across Block Boundaries  
When raise is called from inside a block, rescue doesn't catch it.

## The Critical Compiler Bug Discovered üêõ

When comparing instance variable to nil in if statement within block context:
- @exc_stack = 0x60be2130 (valid pointer)
- nil = 0x3 (fixnum)
- But "if @exc_stack == nil" evaluates to TRUE (WRONG!)

The == comparison is broken for object pointers vs nil in block contexts.

## Impact
‚úÖ Can use rescue in methods and top-level
‚ùå Cannot catch exceptions from block.call in methods taking &block
‚ùå Blocks test frameworks, iterators with exception handling
