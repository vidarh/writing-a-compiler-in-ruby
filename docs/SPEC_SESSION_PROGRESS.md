# Spec Failure Investigation Session - Progress Report

## Completed

### 1. Systematic Investigation
- Analyzed all 68 Integer spec failures
- Categorized by error type (COMPILE_FAIL, SEGFAULT, FAIL)
- Created comprehensive docs/SPEC_ANALYSIS.md

### 2. Fixed Issues

#### Float#__get_raw stub (Issue: SEGFAULT → FAIL)
- Added Float#__get_raw method returning 0
- **Impact**: to_s_spec moved from SEGFAULT to FAIL
- **Status**: 1 spec improved (now runs 6/21 tests)

#### FloatDomainError class
- Added to lib/core/exception.rb
- Allows divmod_spec to compile
- **Impact**: 1 spec compiles now

#### Integer() conversion method
- Added global Integer() method in lib/core/integer.rb
- Provides integer conversion like Array()
- **Status**: Partially working (still investigating crashes)

#### Mock framework improvements
- Added Mock#to_i for integer conversion
- Added mock_int() helper and MockInt class
- **Impact**: digits_spec completes without crash (0/11 passed)

#### Fixnum#times improvement
- Fixed to yield index parameter
- Was: `yield` → Now: `yield i`
- **Status**: Fixed but spec still crashes (deeper issue with blocks)

## In Progress

### GDB Investigation of Segfaults
**Finding**: Many segfaults occur during block/lambda execution
- Pattern: Crash at invalid addresses during Proc#call
- Examples: times_spec, uminus_spec
- Root cause: Appears to be compiler issue with block closure handling
- **Decision**: Too complex for quick fix, needs architectural investigation

## Identified Issues Requiring Targeted Fixes

### High Priority - Small Changes

1. **Bitwise complement ~ operator** (1 FAIL spec)
   - complement_spec returns 0 instead of complement
   - Need to implement ~ operator
   - **Effort**: Low - add operator support

2. **Bitwise operations wrong** (3 FAIL specs)
   - allbits?, anybits?, nobits? have wrong logic
   - **Effort**: Medium - fix boolean logic

3. **tokens.rb:383 NoMethodError** (10+ COMPILE_FAIL)
   - Parser/tokenizer bug with certain syntax
   - **Effort**: Medium-High - requires parser debugging

## Test Results Summary

### Before Session
- PASS: 7, FAIL: 16, SEGFAULT: 23, COMPILE_FAIL: 22

### After Current Fixes
- PASS: 7, FAIL: 17 (+1), SEGFAULT: 22 (-1), COMPILE_FAIL: 22
- **Net improvement**: 1 spec moved from SEGFAULT to FAIL

### Specs Improved
1. to_s_spec: SEGFAULT → FAIL (6/21 tests pass)
2. digits_spec: Completes without crash
3. divmod_spec: Now compiles

## Next Steps (Not Completed)

1. Implement ~ (complement) operator
2. Fix allbits?/anybits?/nobits? logic
3. Investigate tokens.rb:383 parser bug
4. Deeper investigation of block/lambda segfaults (architectural)

## Notes

- FloatDomainError initially caused assembly errors on incremental builds
- Clean rebuild (rm -rf out/*) resolved the issue
- Many segfaults trace to block execution - suggests compiler bug with closures
- Integer() method exists but may have issues when called (needs more testing)
