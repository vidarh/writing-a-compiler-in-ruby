# This is necessary because we need to be able to create an Array
# for the splat handling, and since Class.new needs to handle variable
# arguments, we *can not* allocate additional objects, because if we
# do, we'll end up with endless recursion. Which means we *can not*
# call Array.new in the splat handling, since that's actually
# Class.new.
#
# This also means that `Array#initialize` *can not* allocate objects,
# which may be / is a complication, as it means it can not even assign
# integers. At the moment I've partially untangled this by changing
# Array#initialize to use %s(...), but while that may be more efficient,
# it ties us into using s-expressions all over the place in the
# implementation of Array, which I'm not pleased with.
