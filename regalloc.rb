# RegisterAllocator
#
# We have two principal forms of register usage:
# - temporary intermediate calculations
# - as a "cache" 
#
# These two are in conflict. We maintain a list of
# "possible" registers. 
#
# We then receive a prioritized list of variables
# to cache. The priority is used to determine which
# register to evict first if we run out of free
# registers.
#
# Note that this register allocator is extremely
# simplistic and does not in any way try to take
# into account control flows. The client (Emitter /
# Compiler classes) is expected to ensure the evict_all
# method is called at appropriate places to prevent
# the cache content from being relied on in situations
# where it is invalid (e.g. consider an if ... else .. end
# where a register is put into the cache in the "if" arm,
# in which case relying on this value being present in
# the "else" arm is obviously broken).
#
# We also don't attempt any kind of reordering etc.
# to maximize the utility of the register allocation.
#
# This is, in other words, the bare minimum we can
# get away with to see some benefits.
#
# If no register is free when we want a temporary
# register:
#
# - We evict one of the cached variables.
# - If there are still no registers free, we raise an
#   error for now - it means we're careless about number
#   of registers somewhere. Naughty.
#
#
# SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
#
# * Assignment or other mutation:
#
#   Anywhere where the register is mutated, it *must* be
#   marked as dirty, and a suitable spill block must be
#   passed in to write the content back to memory when
#   evicting the register. Note that this also makes it
#   paramount that registers are evicted in any places
#   where writing the contents back is necessary.
#
#   FIXME: We currently will write the content back
#   even if we have passed the last place a variable
#   is actually used.
#
# * Loops:
#
#   Variables allocated outside of the loop must either
#   be allowed to stay in the same register, or be treated as
#   evicted. For now we'll just evict all registers at the
#   start of a loop iteration to avoid dealing with the complexities.
#
# * Lambda etc.
#
#   All variables must be evicted. But we treat lambdas as functions
#   at lower level, so we get that "for free"
# 
# * Aliasing
#
#   If a "let" aliases an outer variable, we need to evict that variable
#   on entry and exit
#
class RegisterAllocator

  # Represents a value cached in a register. For each cached instance,
  # we keep the register name itself as a Symbol, an (optional) block
  # to call when evicting this cached value from the register, that the
  # emitter will use to spill the register back to memory. This is set
  # only if a cached value is "dirtied" (by e.g. an assignment)
  #
  # Cached registers can get evicted at any time. So if we want a
  # temporary register that needs to stay "live", we need to treat it
  # differently. If we have a value that is already in a register, we
  # allow "locking" it into place by setting the "locked" attribute
  # of the cache entry.
