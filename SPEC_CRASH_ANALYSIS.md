# Integer Spec Crash Analysis - Session 30

## Quick Fixes Completed

### 1. Fixed: "undefined method '>' for NilClass" crashes (HIGH IMPACT)
**Files Fixed:** lib/core/integer.rb
**Lines:** 324, 354, 468
**Specs Fixed:** even_spec.rb, odd_spec.rb, and likely many others

**Issue:** Three critical methods were returning `nil` instead of `0`:
1. `__compare_magnitudes` - returned nil when all limbs were equal
2. `__add_heap_and_heap` - returned nil when magnitudes equal (two places)

**Impact:** These nil values caused crashes when used in comparisons like `cmp > 0`.

**Specs Now Passing:**
- even_spec.rb (6/6 tests pass)
- odd_spec.rb (5/5 tests pass)

**Commit:** cae9f65 - "Fix critical bugs in Integer arithmetic..."

## Remaining Crash Categories

### 2. Coercion Protocol Crashes (MEDIUM COMPLEXITY)
**Error:** "Integer can't be coerced into Integer"
**Affected Specs:** bit_and_spec, bit_or_spec, bit_xor_spec, divide_spec, multiply_spec, and others

**Issue:** Binary operators (/, *, &, |, ^, etc.) don't properly implement the Ruby coercion protocol.
- When given a non-Integer argument, should call `other.coerce(self)`
- Instead, they raise TypeError immediately
- Tests use mock objects that implement coerce

**Example Test:**
```ruby
obj = mock("fixnum bit and")
obj.should_receive(:coerce).with(6).and_return([6, 3])
(6 & obj).should == 2  # Should call obj.coerce(6) -> [6, 3], then do 6 & 3 = 2
```

**Fix Complexity:** Medium - requires implementing coerce protocol in:
- Division (/)
- Multiplication (*)
- Bitwise operations (&, |, ^, <<, >>)
- Other binary operators

### 3. Missing Exception Handling (MEDIUM COMPLEXITY)
**Affected Specs:** divide_spec, ceildiv_spec, divmod_spec, div_spec, modulo_spec

**Issues:**
- Division by zero doesn't raise ZeroDivisionError (for integer division)
- TypeError not raised for invalid argument types (when coerce not implemented)
- Tests expect exceptions but nothing is raised

**Examples:**
- `1 / 0` should raise ZeroDivisionError, currently doesn't
- `13 / "10"` should raise TypeError, currently doesn't

**Fix Complexity:** Medium - need to add proper exception raising in division/modulo

### 4. Float Support Missing (HIGH COMPLEXITY - SKIP)
**Affected Specs:** divide_spec, fdiv_spec, to_f_spec

**Issues:**
- Float division returns stub Float objects (0.0)
- Division by zero with Float (1 / 0.0) should return "Infinity", returns "0.0"
- Proper float arithmetic not implemented

**Fix Complexity:** High - requires full Float implementation
**Recommendation:** Document and skip for now

### 5. Parser Bug: "or break" (KNOWN ISSUE)
**Affected Spec:** times_spec.rb

**Issue:** Code like `a.shift or break` causes `break` to be interpreted as a method call
**Fix Complexity:** Parser fix required
**Status:** Already on TODO list

## Recommended Next Steps

### Quick Wins (Session 30):
1. ~~Fix nil return bugs~~ ✅ DONE - Fixed even_spec, odd_spec
2. Check for other similar nil return patterns in integer.rb

### Medium Complexity (Future Sessions):
3. Implement coercion protocol for binary operators
4. Add proper exception raising for division by zero, type errors
5. Fix bitwise operations (incorrect results even when they don't crash)

### Long Term (Document Only):
6. Float arithmetic implementation
7. Parser fixes for "or break"

## Summary Statistics (Before Fixes)

From spec_failures_new.txt:
- Total spec files: 67
- Crashed (no test output): 20
- Segfault (parser bug): 1
- Pass: 11
- Fail (with output): 55

## Actual Impact After Fixes

Results after applying nil return fixes:
- **Spec files passing: 11 → 13** (+2: even_spec, odd_spec)
- **Crashes reduced: 20 → 17** (-3 specs no longer crash)
- **Total tests: 309 → 320** (+11 tests now complete instead of crashing early)
- **Passing tests: 144 → 155** (+11 tests)
- **Pass rate: 46% → 48%** (+2 percentage points)

### Specs Fixed (No Longer Crashing):
- even_spec.rb - now PASS (6/6 tests pass)
- odd_spec.rb - now PASS (5/5 tests pass)
- One additional spec no longer crashes

### Remaining Crashes (17 specs):
All related to coercion protocol or missing functionality:
- bit_and_spec, bit_or_spec, bit_xor_spec
- ceildiv_spec, divide_spec, divmod_spec, div_spec
- element_reference_spec, exponent_spec, integer_spec
- left_shift_spec, modulo_spec, multiply_spec
- pow_spec, right_shift_spec, round_spec, to_r_spec
- (times_spec was previously known but no longer in list - may be fixed or changed)

## Files Modified

- lib/core/integer.rb:
  - Line 324: Added `return 0` to __add_heap_and_fixnum when magnitudes equal
  - Line 354: Added `return 0` to __add_heap_and_heap when magnitudes equal
  - Line 468: Added `return 0` to __compare_magnitudes when all limbs equal

## Testing

Run full test suite:
```bash
./run_rubyspec rubyspec/core/integer/
```

Test specific fixed specs:
```bash
./run_rubyspec rubyspec/core/integer/even_spec.rb
./run_rubyspec rubyspec/core/integer/odd_spec.rb
```

## Notes

- All fixes are in lib/core/integer.rb
- Compiler must be rebuilt after changes: `make compiler`
- These bugs were present because methods had comment indicating what to return but missing `return` statement
- Pattern to watch for: Comments like "# Magnitudes equal - result is 0" followed by empty line and `else`
